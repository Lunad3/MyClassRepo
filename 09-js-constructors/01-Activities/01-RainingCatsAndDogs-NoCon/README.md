# **Instructions**

* Review 01 and 02 from our previous class.  Explain to your partner the differences between the two pieces of code.

* Also answer the following questions:

  * What do constructors do?

  * Why are they important/how do they help us?

  * Think of an example from the past assignments/projects where you could have used a constructor to help, why does it help in this situation?  (Hint: constructors aren't always necessary.)
