# Tips for Learning Programming Languages, Tools & Concepts

# Ask Yourself
- Why dod we need it?
- When do we use it?
- What does it look like?
- How does it work?
- Best plug-n-play question: How does `X` relate to `Y` so that I can `Z` when `Q` happens?

# Troubleshooting your development
- Pseudocode (planning)
  - Planning out your steps however small (written) down, helps to clear up what you're attempting to accomplish
  - Make a big task into smaller steps
  - `Make a sandwich` versus `Go to fridge then get bread then get cheese, then get mustard, then get mayo, then get ham, get 2 slices of bread, open slices to either side, get knife, dip knife in mayo, spread mayo on one side of bread, clean knife, dip knife in mustard, spread mustard on one side of the other piece of bread, place hameon bread with mayo on it, place cheese on other slice of bread with mustard on it, face cheese side to ham side and press together, enjoy sandwich`
- Try it a few times
  - experiment with a simple way to see how it works, break it a few times in different configurations to understand it's nature
  - it's ok if it breaks
  - getting new error messages means progress
- Read your error messages
  - error messages are you friend and will tell you how to fix things
  - part of the message will tell you the line and number ex. 11:22 means line 12, character 22
  - again NEW error messages are GOOD
- `console.log()` everything until you get better uing your `debugger`
- Read documentation
  - documentation usually has an example that showcases how the thing works that you want to work
- Use Google to search your problem in the form of the question including keywords
  - "My CSS does not work in my HTML to add COLOR when I place my DIV on the RIGHT side POSITION of the SCREEN"
  - "CSS HTML COLOR DIV RIGHT POSITION SCREEN"
- Try out the resources you Google'd
  - Listen to Podcasts
  - Watch YouTube tutorials
  - Read StackOverflow answers
  - Read software engineer blog articles
- Don't burn out, take a breath or short walk. Stepping away for a second is ok.
- Pair Programming
  - Two heads are better than one
  - Specifically working together on the same problem using the same computer
    - One person `drives`: types on the keyboard listening to the partner, but doesn't speak on how to solve the problem
    - Other person `navigates`: speaks technically to their partner on how to solve the problem
    - Partners change roles ever 10 to 15 minutes
    - It's ok to Google together for both partners
    - `Create a function that adds two numbers and returns the result` is better than `Type "function" then "parentheses" then "two inputs called foo & bar" then..."`
  - Improves technical speak, ability to describe problems/solutions, syntax of code, memory recall of recently learned items
- Talk to yourself
  - out loud is better (whispers are good in class or mouthing the words in silence)
  - talk to a `rubber ducky`, action figure, doll, pet, reflection -- anything to get your thoughts into words
- Ask the staff for help
  - question
  - 1-on-1
