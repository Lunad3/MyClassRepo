# Installation

* [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

* Follow download instructions on the page.

# Setup

* Sign in with Github or sign up for a git kraken account.

* Follow instructions when signing in.

* Unless you want to pay money, _don't sign up for pro_

* If you already have repos on your computer (which you do) click File -> Open Repo and navigate to it.

* Now you have a visual gui for all the git actions we have learned in the terminal, including being able to see every commit in tree form, and a lot of benefits for finding more things that you can do!

* Git kraken is very easy for merge conflict resolution as well.
